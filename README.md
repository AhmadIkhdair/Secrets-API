# Random Activity Generator

## Description

This is a small challenge to practice the use of API's. Secrets API by the App Brewery is used to generate a random secret added by a user everytime a request is made.

You can create your own account / get a bearer token to write your own secrets, but that won't be part of this small challenge.

This challenge's main focus was to practice the use of Axios, for making server-side API requests.
